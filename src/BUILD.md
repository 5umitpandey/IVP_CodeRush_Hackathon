Here we are working on multiple inputs of human and then basically create charts like pie chart or bar graph or line graph to visualize those features.

We also calculate avg sleep by dividing the total sleep (in hours) by total number of days input is provided.

By doing this, person can see how much sleep and what mood he was in for the past week or days.
